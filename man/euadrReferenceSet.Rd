\description{
A reference set of 43 drug-outcome pairs where we believe the drug causes the outcome (
positive controls) and 50 drug-outcome pairs where we believe the drug does not cause the 
outcome (negative controls). The controls involve 10 health outcomes of interest. Note that
originally, there was an additional positive control (Nimesulide and acute liver injury), but
Nimesulide is not in RxNorm, and is not available in many countries.
