Description: This package contains resources for the evaluation of the performance of methods that aim to estimate 
  the magnitude (relative risk) of the effect of a drug on an outcome. These resources include reference sets for evaluating
  methods on real data, as well as functions for inserting simulated effects in real data based on negative control drug-outcome pairs.
  Further included are functions for the computation of the minimum detectable relative risks and functions for computing performance 
  statistics such as predictive accuracy, error and bias.
