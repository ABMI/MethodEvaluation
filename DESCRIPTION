Description: This package contains resources for the evaluation of the
    performance of methods that aim to estimate the magnitude (relative risk) of
    the effect of a drug on an outcome. These resources include reference sets for
    evaluating methods on real data, as well as functions for inserting simulated
    effects in real data based on negative control drug-outcome pairs. Further
    included are functions for the computation of the minimum detectable relative
    risks and functions for computing performance statistics such as predictive
    accuracy, error and bias.
